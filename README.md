# Computer-Generated-Holograms
Matlab code for the generation of computer generated holograms to display on spatial light modulators.
Holograms can alter the just phase of the beam or both the amplitude and phase. I'll post 2 methods for encoding the amplitude of the desired field (Arrizon or straighforward) and exhibit 2 kind of gratings (blazed or sinusoidal).
